One cause for such imbalance might be due to the large amount memes, images, and other links that are anti-Trump, authors from Enough Trump Spam simply share these images and links instead of writing text. On the other side, there aren't as many outside resource for pro-Trump authors, so they need to use more words to explain their opinions. \n",
